# Scrapping-Clustering-News-R
This contain all the codes used to complete my thesis assignment. I was earning my bachelor degree in ITB as a mathematical student. As I was limited by knowledges of programming world also with the time given, I with the helped of my colleague, could only managed to do some things. They will be contained in this repository, and they are:
1. Scrapping the news on the Internet from the scratch using HTML and R Studio (from 2 different sources)
2. Do the data cleansing and analysis from the raw datas
3. Clustering from the data which had passed the statistical tests (I won't include the statistical tests, but only the clustering)
